# tfc-medic-job

- This Plugin is still work in Progress...

- A Simple Plugin for the Athena Framework (Version 4) -> ALT:V
- Gives your Faction a Command for Displaying a Webview for the [vCAD](https://vcad.li/) Medicnet system. (You still need an Account for their System. Register here: https://vcad.li/register.php)
- Plus: You can use this Interface to heal or revive Players that are currently Online

* Command: /medicjob (Displays the Webinterface in Game for Medicnet and Player Actions)
- at the moment you need to be an Admin or Moderator to use that command. I will add a config in the future

* Install the Folder into src/core/plugins/
